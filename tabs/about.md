I'm a passionate Mobile Application Developer having 6+ yr experience. I enjoy the development of App from the scratch.  
I have experience in the following fields also IoT, Healthcare, Alexa, tvOS, Mobile App UI designs.  
I had been doing App Development contracting for a few years in college, I started my career as a freelance Android Developer while I was doing my UG itself.Later, I decided to specialise in iOS only and no longer take on work on other platforms.  
I got my first iOS job at Mobotactics IT Solutions Pvt. Ltd. in 2014.  
Now, I have been worked around 30+ Apps, and most of them are currently in Appstore. Also, working on the Apps maintenance too. I would always like to learn new things and technologies.  
I do always like to work on challenging Projects and tasks.
