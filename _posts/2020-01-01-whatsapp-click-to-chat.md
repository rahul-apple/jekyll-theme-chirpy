## How to use click to chat

WhatsApp's click to chat feature allows you to begin a chat with someone without having their phone number saved in your phone's address book. As long as you know this person’s phone number and they have an active WhatsApp account, you can create a link that will allow you to start a chat with them. By clicking the link, a chat with the person automatically opens. Click to chat works on both your phone and WhatsApp Web.

### Create your own link
Use ```https://wa.me/<number>``` where the ```<number>``` is a full phone number in international format. Omit any zeroes, brackets, or dashes when adding the phone number in international format.

Examples:

Use: ```https://wa.me/15551234567```

Don't use: ```https://wa.me/+001-(555)1234567```

#### Create your own link with a pre-filled message

The pre-filled message will automatically appear in the text field of a chat. Use ```https://wa.me/whatsappphonenumber?text=urlencodedtext``` where ```whatsappphonenumber``` is a full phone number in international format and ```urlencodedtext``` is the URL-encoded pre-filled message.

Example: [https://wa.me/917907223952?text=I'm%20interested%20in%20your%20car%20for%20sale](https://wa.me/917907223952?text=I'm%20interested%20in%20your%20car%20for%20sale)

To create a link with just a pre-filled message, use ```https://wa.me/?text=urlencodedtext```

Example: ```https://wa.me/?text=I'm%20inquiring%20about%20the%20apartment%20listing```

After clicking on the link, you’ll be shown a list of contacts you can send your message to.
